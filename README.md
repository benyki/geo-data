# Geo Data Enrichment Project

This project takes various geographical datasets, cleans them, enriches them with additional information like coordinates and URL-friendly slugs, and prepares them for loading into a PostgreSQL database.

## Data Sources

The datasets used in this project come from the following sources:

*   **French Geographical Data:** Official data for communes, departments, regions, and postal codes was sourced from the French government's open data platform, [**data.gouv.fr**](https://www.data.gouv.fr/).
*   **World Cities, States, and Countries:** A comprehensive database of world cities, states, and countries was provided by mexwell on Kaggle.
*   **Country Emojis and Alternate Names:** The file containing country names, emojis, and ISO codes was sourced from Google.
